![Crunchbang Linux Install](/assets/crunchbang.jpg)

I have not been thrilled with the Unity or Gnome 3 interfaces and have come very close to giving up on linux on the desktop and switching back to the Mac.  However I still like the linux command line and apt package managers, and most things I make are deployed to linux, so i've hesitated.  

This weekend I installed <a href="http://www.crunchbanglinux.org">crunchbang linux</a> on my laptop.  I've always liked openbox, which is a simple window manager, but it took lots of configuration to get it working like a whole desktop.  Crunchbang takes debian and adds a nicely configured openbox desktop to it.

And it has the best disclaimer ever: CrunchBang Linux could possibly make your computer go CRUNCH! BANG!
