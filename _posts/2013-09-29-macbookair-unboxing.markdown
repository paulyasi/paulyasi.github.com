I couldn't take looking at the boring gray crunchbang linux desktop anymore.  Shouldn't this computer stuff be fun?  So I switched back to the Mac after about 8 years away from them.  I had used a Powerbook G4, and before that a Quadra, a IIci, and a 512k, so my history with macs goes back to nearly the beginning.  In doing web development, my development on the Powerbook was never quite close enough to the linux server, and weird issues would often crop up between the two configurations.  This pushed me to switch to linux on the desktop.  

For a while I was very happy with Ubuntu on a Thinkpad.  With the advent of Unity and Gnome 3 it has left behind some of the conventions that have been part of window, menu, icon, and pointer interfaces for decades.  I tried to live with it for a while, but things got to me after some time.  One of the things that drove me absolutely crazy in unity was that it hides menu headings when not hovering over the menu bar.  They think this is ok too:

> to which you can refer just by looking at it" - Mark Shuttleworth

With the Mac having a command line that runs most of what I need, and linux having taken over the cloud and virtual machines there is now almost no reason to run one as a web development desktop.  If I need to do something with a linux server I can run it in a VM or rent one for pennies per hour on the internet.

I'm also happy to be back on the Mac with applications like iPhoto and iTunes.  Which while iTunes is a monstrosity of a program, when you have over 50 gigabytes of music like I do, it's a  necessary monstrosity.  Nothing else ever been as easy to navigate it.  I miss being able to easily enjoy my music collection.

I'm also looking forward to using iPhoto when taking raw photos out of my camera too.

I can process photos out of my camera very easily, and I don't have to reboot into windows to use the stripped down software that came with the camera or use linux with rawtherapee (which didn't have the best color management). 

Since I've restarted my blog here, I want to make sure I can still run the jekyll blog generator on the command line and still scp blog posts up to my server too, or else you wouldn't be able to read this.

I think the 11" MacBook Air will be a nice little web development and blogging machine.
