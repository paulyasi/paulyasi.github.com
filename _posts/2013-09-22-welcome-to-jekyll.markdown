I'm relaunching my blog with Jekyll, and I hope to post more often.  There is a new wordpress vulnerability and I've got 28000 spam comments in my wordpress blog, so I'm giving up on wordpress - but i've got lots of old posts in wordpress.  Not sure how i'll more those over here yet.

With jekyll I can manage it all locally on my computer and then publish my changes with a single scp.
