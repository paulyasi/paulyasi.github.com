You can find my open source projects on <a href="http://www.github.com/paulyasi">github</a> and <a href="http://pyasi.users.sourceforge.net/">sourceforge</a>.  Most notably I am the lead developer of the <a href="http://www.citrusdb.org">CitrusDB Customer Database</a> and I also maintain the <a href="https://github.com/paulyasi/forest-monk-theme">Forest Monk Color Scheme</a> for Emacs and Vim

I also blog at this site about web design and development, paleo and real food, and whatever else I'm thinking about.
